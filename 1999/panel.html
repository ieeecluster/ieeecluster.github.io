<b><font color="#FF0000">Software Tools for Cluster Computing -- </font><font color="#000000">David
Abramson</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Clusters are a very cheap way of gaining computing
power. However, the challenge is to produce software&nbsp; environments
that provide an illusion of a single resource, rather than a collection
of independent computers. I will briefly address this issue.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Parallelising compilers -- </font><font color="#000000">Bill
Appelbe</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Twenty years of research and development in parallelizing
compilers still leaves us far short of the "holy grail" of a tool that
could automatically convert serial programs into efficient parallel programs.
The open question is what progress is likely in the next decade, and how
compiler technology and tools will affect the adopting of cluster computing
by a broad user community beyond expert programmers.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Beowulf cluster systems --</font><font color="#000000">
Ken Hawick</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Beowulf cluster systems are becoming widely prevalent
at academic and industrial sites across the world.&nbsp; There are clear
price-performance benefits over conventional supercomputer systems for
many applications.&nbsp; Recent developments suggest that the Beowulf model
is becoming viable not only for task farming applications but for large
scale parallel programs with more intensive communications patterns. These
issues are of great interest for the future of both cluster computing and
parallel computing.&nbsp; Work is in progress to embody the research ideas
in parallel computing from the last 20 years into libraries and templates</font>
<br><font color="#000000">of code to aid the use of Beowulf systems. Some
links are given at:&nbsp; http://dhpc.adelaide.edu.au/projects/beowulf</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>DISCWorld</b> -- </font><b><font color="#000000">Ken
Hawick</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">DISCWorld is a long term project to research the
issues in building long lived, robust, distributed metacomputing systems.&nbsp;
A great deal of software technology, particularly from the last few years
enables "Problem Solving Environments" to be built.&nbsp; These aid non-specialists
or rather application domain experts to use distributed clustered resources
- both on their local network as well as services provided by specialist
remote servers at other sites.&nbsp; DISCWorld is an attempt to assimilate
state-of-the-art research ideas into a high level concept framework, manifesting
itself as an ongoing series of prototypes and technology integration studies.

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Scheduling --</font><font color="#000000">
Albert Zomaya</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">In either sequential or parallel systems, the
architecture is characterized by functional components, the communication
topology and facilities, and control</font>
<br><font color="#000000">structures and mechanisms. However, there are
several issues related to parallelization that do not arise in sequential
programming. One of the most important issues is task-allocation, that
is the breakdown of the total workload into smaller tasks assigned to different
processors, and the proper sequencing of the tasks when some</font>
<br><font color="#000000">of them are interdependent and cannot be executed
simultaneously. To achieve the highest level of performance it is important
to ensure that each processor is properly utilized. This process is called
load-balancing or scheduling and it is considered to be extremely "formidable"
to solve. The scheduling problem belong</font>
<br><font color="#000000">to a class of problems known as NP-complete.
See http://www.ee.uwa.edu.au/~paracomp/projects.html.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Applications of the Swinburne Supercluster
in Astrophysics --</font><font color="#000000"> Matthew Bailes</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">The Swinburne supercluster is a 65-node configuration
of alpha workstations which is involved in several major projects involving
large-scale processing. The applicability of clusters to observational
astronomy will be discussed along with tools to manage the processing and
the proposed upgrade of the system to 256 nodes.</font>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Parallel/cluster computing at ANU</b> -- </font><b><font color="#000000">Chris
Johnson</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Parallel and cluster computing at ANU have a long
history and a diversity of projects and interests. There is a history of
programming systems and operating</font>
<br><font color="#000000">systems research and development on the Fujitsu
multiprocessor computers that range from AP1000 (128 x SPARC 1) to AP3000
(12 x 170 MHz UltraSparc)</font>
<br><font color="#000000">on fast proprietary networks, ranging from proprietary
operating systems to Linux, and some (applications) history with a Thinking
Machines CM-5. There are currently at least 2 Beowulf clusters at ANU within
the strict classification: 12 x 533 MHz Alphas on Fast Ethernet at ANU
Supercomputer Facility (Ben Evans), and 9 x 400MHz Pentium IIs at Research
School of Information Sciences and Engineering (Jonathan Baxter); and a
project to purchase a 128 processor system</font>
<br><font color="#000000">is under way (combined RSISE and Dept of Computer
Science), for a variety of applications and systems development projects.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">In systems, the commodity cluster movement has
been trading off faster communication against cost, and the proprietary
machines' networks have also lost their previous balance of communications
speed against processor speed. The two approaches have in common the need
for operating systems developments to</font>
<br><font color="#000000">improve communications speeds through optimistic
protocols, minimal buffering, user-process level calls, and coordinated
scheduling of processes across the</font>
<br><font color="#000000">cluster. I expect that recent experience with
the proprietary machines will feed across to developments in the Linux
domain. It is also a concern to see that the software development environments
for clusters are still at a very low level; simple, widely applicable,
portable tools for the Linux cluster environment are a priority.</font>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">The Mianjin Parallel Programming Language --
</font><font color="#000000">Paul
Roe</font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">We have designed and implemented a parallel programming
language, Mianjin, for programming non-dedicated clusters of workstations.
Mianjin supports a virtual shared object space and uses type information
to enforce safe communication in the presence of abstractions. I will outline
some of the interesting features of Mianjin and our current cluster computing
research at QUT www.plasrc.qut.edu.au/Gardens.</font>

<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Operating Systems and Execution Environments Supporting Parallel Processing on Clusters --
</font><font color="#000000">Andrzej M. Goscinski</font></b>

<p>
Many research groups from universities, research laboratories and industry have been involved in the last few years in studying
the development of software which would enable efficient parallel processing on Clusters. Some results, in particular in the
area
of finding and expressing parallelism, are very good. However, parallelism management problems do not have satisfactory
solutions and lessons learnt in one area are not used to form a uniform vision and approach to developing software to support
parallel processing on Clusters. Available parallel programming packages, parallel programming languages and parallelising
compilers are only supported by classical network operating systems, e.g., Unix-based. Parallelism management is very limited
and does not go beyond basic process and communication management. Thus, there is a need to identify and discuss the basic
issues of and solutions to the management of parallel processing on Clusters, and to propose a new solution. It is claimed that
parallelism management be offered by an operating system that inherits some features of a distributed operating system and
provides new services which address the needs of parallel processes, Cluster’s resources, and application programmers. This
approach will allow the achievement of high performance of parallel processing on Clusters; relieve the programmer from error
prone and time consuming work of allocation of processes to workstations, interprocess communication and process
synchronization; provide single system image by supporting transparency; make the whole Cluster based parallel system easy to
use, and allow to use resources efficiently.</p>

<b><font color="#FF0000">Australian Partnership for Advanced Computing (APAC) Plans and Strategies
-- </font><font color="#000000">John O'Callaghan </font></b>

<p>
The Australian Partnership for Advanced Computing (APAC) has been
established with a grant of $19.5m from the Federal Government to underpin
significant achievements in Australian research, education and technology
diffusion by establishing and supporting an effective advanced computing
capability ranked in the top 10 countries.
 One of the roles for APAC is to provide users particularly in the Higher
 Education sector with 'peak' computing systems far beyond the capacity that
 is currently available. Another important role for APAC is to strengthen
 the expertise and skills necessary for the effective use and development of
 these facilities.
  The broader role for APAC is to form a partnership to lead the development
  of an Australia-wide computing and communications systems infrastructure
  supported by Centres of Expertise in advanced computing. 
  APAC is in the process of selecting a peak computing system for a National
  Facility to be based at the ANU, and developing strategies for
  strengthening complementary infrastructure at other locations around
  Australia.
  The talk will outline the current state of the APAC plans and strategies.
