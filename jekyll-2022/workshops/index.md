Experts in cluster computing are invited to share their expertise with the
community by submitting proposals for workshops to be co-located with the
Cluster 2022 conference that will be held on September 6-9, 2022 in Heidelberg,
Germany. The Cluster 2022 workshop program will provide an opportunity to
present preliminary work related to the topics covered by the conference and
will give attendees access to the latest works-in-progress in the field.
Workshop proposals can cover a broad range of topics on the design, use, or
management of clusters and supporting technologies from throughout the software
stack. All workshops will be held on September 6th, 2022.

* Cluster node and system hardware;
* Cluster/distributed operating and runtime systems;
* Parallel programming models, languages, runtimes, and environments;
* Performance evaluation, analysis, and optimization;
* Fault-tolerance, resilience, reliability, and high availability;
* Data management and distributed and parallel file systems;
* Visualization, data analytics, and workflows;
* Cluster management tools including resource management;
* Power management, energy, and cooling;
* High-performance networks and communication systems;
* Clouds and distributed systems;
* Combining and enabling unique workloads (e.g. concurrent machine learning, data-centric computing, and compute-heavy applications)
