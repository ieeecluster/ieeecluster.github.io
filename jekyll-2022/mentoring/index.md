# Student Mentoring Program

The Student Mentoring Program at IEEE Cluster 2022 is a program for PhD,
Masters, and Undergraduate students to help students build their
scientific careers. While the scientific presentations and interactions
with conference attendees during the conference help students develop
their technical skills, the Student Mentoring Program complements and
extends this development by fostering the integration of the students
into the Cluster scientific community, advising them to plan their
professional career in academia or industry, improving their scientific
communication skills, and providing them with the right entry points for
efficient professional networking.

## Applying to the Mentoring Program

All interested students can apply through a simple process, by providing
a short description of why they want to participate in the conference,
information on any works submitted to the conference or associated
workshops, the name of their advisor, and their CV. The student’s
adviser should endorse the student’s application and will be contacted
once the application is submitted.

## Student attendance awards - for students at U.S. institutions

Thanks to the National Science Foundation, several attendance awards
will be available for students enrolled in US institutions and
participating in the Student Mentoring Program at the IEEE Cluster 2022
conference. Students with accepted papers in the main conference track
or in workshops, or students with posters must apply to and participate
in the Student Mentoring Program to be eligible for the attendance
award. Notice of awards will be made prior to the conference. The awards
will be distributed post-conference in the form of reimbursements
against registration expense submitted by the student. Both graduate and
undergraduate students can apply.
