DESCRIPTION:Tensor decomposition is widely used in machine learning\, reco
 mmendation systems\, and social networks. Parallel algorithms running on d
 istributed memory systems are required to solve large real-world tensors. 
 Parallel algorithms suffer two major performance bottlenecks: load imbalan
 ce and communication cost\, which are difficult to overcome due to the inh
 erent tradeoff among the multiple types of computations and communications
 \, especially for irregular sparse tensors. Previous work predominately fo
 cuses on balancing the load within the tensor-related computation\, result
 ing in imbalance for multiple matrix-only computations and increased commu
 nication costs. It also extensively uses collective communication operatio
 ns and bulk-synchronous computations by interleaving stages of global comm
 unication and stages of local computation\, failing to hide the communicat
 ion cost. In this paper\, we present a novel algorithm BALA-CPD\, which ac
 hieves the best overall workload balance\, and efficiently overlaps commun
 ication and computation for the popular distributed Canonical Polyadic Dec
 omposition (CPD) algorithms. BALA-CPD uses a workload and data partition s
 cheme that prioritizes the load balance for all the matrix-only computatio
 ns and all the communications. When necessary\, BALA-CPD adjusts to mitiga
 te the load imbalance for the tensor-related computation. Departing from t
 he bulk-synchronous approaches\, BALA-CPD breaks down computation and comm
 unication in consecutive stages\, and masks the communication costs by a c
 ombination of one-sided asynchronous communication and a fine-grained inte
 rleaving of communication and computation. We implement BALA-CPD and evalu
 ate it on a 64-node cluster with 1280 processors. Experimental results sho
 w BALA-CPD is scalable and outperforms the state-of-the-art distributed im
 plementations by up to 1.8X on 1280 processors.
