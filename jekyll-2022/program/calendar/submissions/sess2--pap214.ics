DESCRIPTION:Today’s distributed computing infrastructures encompass comp
 lex workflows for real-time data gathering\, transferring\, storage\, and 
 processing\, quickly overwhelming centralized cloud centers. Recently\, th
 e computing continuum that federates the Cloud services with emerging Fog 
 and Edge devices represents a relevant alternative for supporting the next
 -generation data processing workflows. However\, eminent challenges in aut
 omating data processing across the computing continuum still exist\, such 
 as scheduling heterogeneous devices across the Cloud\, Fog\, and Edge laye
 rs. We propose a new scheduling algorithm called C3-MATCH\, based on match
 ing theory principles and involving two sets of players negotiating differ
 ent utility functions: 1) workflow microservices that prefer computing dev
 ices with lower data processing and queuing times\; 2) computing continuum
  devices that prefer microservices with corresponding resource requirement
 s and less data transmission time. We evaluate C3-MATCH using real-world r
 oad sign inspection and sentiment analysis workflows on a federated comput
 ing continuum across four Cloud\, Fog\, and Edge providers. Our combined s
 imulation and real execution results reveal that C3-MATCH achieves up to 6
 7% lower completion time compared to three state-of-the-art methods.
