DESCRIPTION:We give a fast(er)\, communication-free\, parallel constructio
 n of optimal communication schedules that allow broadcasting of $n$ distin
 ct blocks of data from a root processor to all other processors in $1$-por
 ted\, $p$-processor networks with fully bidirectional communication. For a
 ny $p$ and $n$\, broadcasting in this model requires $n-1+\\ceiling{\\log_
 2 p}$ communication rounds. In contrast to other constructions\, all proce
 ssors follow the same\, circulant graph communication pattern\, which make
 s it possible to use the schedules for the allgather (all-to-all-broadcast
 ) operation as well. The new construction takes $O(\\log^3 p)$ time steps 
 per processor\, each of which can compute its part of the schedule indepen
 dently of the other processors in $O(\\log p)$ space. The result is a sign
 ificant improvement over the sequential $O(p \\log^2 p)$ time and $O(p\\lo
 g p)$ space construction of Tr\\"aff and Ripke (2009) with considerable pr
 actical import. The round-optimal schedule construction is then used to im
 plement communication optimal algorithms the broadcast and (irregular) all
 gather collective operations as found in MPI (the Message-Passing Interfac
 e)\, and significantly and practically improve over the implementations in
  standard MPI libraries (\\texttt{mpich}\, OpenMPI\, Intel MPI) for certai
 n problem ranges. The application to the irregular allgather operation is 
 entirely new.
