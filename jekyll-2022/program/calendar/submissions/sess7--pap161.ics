 nce-Portable Simulations

DESCRIPTION:We present the large-scale\, computational fluid dynamics (CFD
 ) simulation of a full gas-turbine engine compressor\, demonstrating capab
 ility towards overcoming current limitations for virtual certification of 
 aero-engine design. The simulation is carried out through a performance po
 rtable code-base on multi-core/many-core HPC clusters with a CFD-to-CFD co
 upled execution\, combining an industrial CFD solver linked using custom c
 oupler software. The application innovates in its design for performance p
 ortability through the OP2 domain specific library for the CFD components\
 , allowing the automatic generation of highly optimized platform-specific 
 parallelizations for both multi-core (CPU) and many-core (GPU) clusters vi
 a a single high-level source. The code is used for the simulation of a 4.5
 8B node\, full-annulus 10-row production-grade test compressor (DLR’s Ri
 g250)\, using a coupled sliding-plane setup on the ARCHER2 and Cirrus supe
 rcomputers at EPCC. The OP2 generated multiple parallelizations\, together
  with optimized coupler configurations on heterogeneous/hybrid settings ac
 hieve\, for the first time\, execution of 1 revolution in less than 6 hour
 s on 512 nodes of ARCHER2 (65k cores)\, with a parallel scaling efficiency
  of over 80% compared to a 107 node run. Results indicate a speed up of th
 e CFD suite by an order of a magnitude (~30x) relative to current producti
 on capability. Benchmarking and performance modelling project a time-to-so
 lution of less than 5 hours on a cluster of 488xNVIDIA V100 GPUs\, about 3
 x-4x speedup over CPU clusters. The work demonstrates a step-change toward
 s achieving virtual certification of aircraft engines with the requisite f
 idelity and tractable time-to-solution that was previously out of reach un
 der production settings.
