The collection of the final (camera-ready) papers as well as the
necessary copyright forms is handled by Conference Publishing Services
(CPS) of the IEEE Computer Society. Authors of accepted conference and
workshop papers will receive the link to the CPS Online Author Kit and
Submission platform with their paper acceptance email. For submitting
your final paper, you need to create an account for this platform, sign
in, and then follow the online instructions. The platform provides all
necessary information, files, templates, and guides you through the
necessary steps to submit your paper. These include uploading of the
final paper according to the [IEEE Xplore formatting
instructions](https://www.computer.org/cms/CPS/app/8x11-2/instruct8.5x11x2.pdf)
