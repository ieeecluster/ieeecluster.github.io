## Travel and Local Transportation

Although Heidelberg does not feature its own airport, it is well connected to the Frankfurt Airport. Additionally, there are a couple of smaller airports around Heidelberg, such as Stuttgart, Frankfurt Hahn, or Baden-Baden.


## **Frankfurt Airport (FRA)**

Frankfurt Airport is the biggest Airport in Germany and serves as the main hub of Lufthansa. It has its own long-distance train station, which makes it easy to reach every major city around Frankfurt.



The time it takes to get to the train station depends on the terminal:

-  Terminal 1 to the Station can be reached by a 10 min walk

-  From terminal 2 it takes about 30 min by shuttle or sky-line.

From the station it takes about 60 min from the Airport to Heidelberg (via Mannheim) for about 27€.

Most hotels also provide an airport shuttle service, while the estimated taxi fare is 150 EUR (one way).

## **Public Transportation (Deutsche Bahn)**

The long-distance train net operated by German Rail (Deutsche Bahn) makes it simple to get anywhere in Germany or Europe by train. While some long-distance trains directly connect Heidelberg with other cities, Mannheim (about 20km from Heidelberg) is the most important railway hub in the southwest of Germany. Travelers can change there for local trains.

Information on schedules and fares is available on the website of German Rail (Deutsche Bahn):

## Selected Local Attractions

Heidelberg, as former residence of the Electorate of the Palatinate, has a rich history and is popular for its baroque old town. Within walking distance, CLUSTER attendees can reach the most popular attractions, such as:


-  **Heidelberg Castle:** World-famous and a byword for German Romanticism – Heidelberg Castle. The castle looks over the entire city of Heidelberg and the Neckar Valley. For five hundred years it was home to the Prince Electors of the Palatinate, but then the castle and its garden were destroyed several times during the Thirty Years' War and the Palatine War of Succession. The castle is surrounded by a beautiful park, where the famous poet Johann von Goethe once walked.


-  **Old Bridge:** Built of Neckar valley sandstone in the 18th century by Prince Karl Theodor, the famous Old Bridge (Alte Brücke) is one of the last large examples of classical stone bridge building. On the city side is the medieval Bridge Gate, part of the former city wall. West of the Bridge Gate, the Heidelberg Bridge Monkey now holds a mirror up to those who look at it. The bronze sculpture was installed there in 1979. But there was a bridge monkey in Heidelberg as far back as the 15th century. Old drawings of the town show it next to the tower on the north end of the Old Bridge. The legend surrounding this curious statue tells us that it symbolizes the fact that neither the city-dwellers nor the people who lived outside the city were better than the other, and that they should look over their shoulder as they cross the bridge to remember this.


-  **Philosophers' Walk**: Following the old bridge from the old town, there is the Philosophers' Walk. The name "Philosophers' Walk" can be traced to the fact that Heidelberg's university professors and philosophers found this path a congenial place where they could talk seriously and contemplate while enjoying the charming view of the Neckar. This view of the town inspired also the poets Eichendorff and Hoelderlin on their walks to write their poems. Even today, this world-famous path offers new sights and insights. Enjoy a beautiful view of Heidelberg and a climate that reminds you of the Italian Tuscany. Many sub-tropical plants flourish in the "Philosophengaertchen".


-  **Old University**: Text books here are meant to be "semper apertus - always open", and the research work of the Ruperto Carola University, founded in 1386, is "geared to the future, yet grounded in tradition". These requirements have been fulfilled in scientific practice by many prominent scholars over the centuries. Great names characterize the history of Germany's oldest university, from Hegel to Jaspers, from Bunsen to Bosch. Around 30,000 students are currently enrolled in 12 faculties and 14 special research areas. Core competencies lie in the field of life science.

Within a day trip there are many more attractions to be visited, such as the Schwetzinger Palace and its Gardens, Neckarsteinach and its four castles (can be reached by boat), Mannheim with its second biggest baroque castle in Europe and birthplace of both, bicycle and car. One of the first major car demonstrations was Bertha Benz’s trip by car in 1888 to Pforzheim, which can actually easily be repeated. At least in today’s standards, and only as close as possible to the original route: [http://www.bertha-benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home](http://www.bertha-benz.de/indexen.php?inhalt=home)
