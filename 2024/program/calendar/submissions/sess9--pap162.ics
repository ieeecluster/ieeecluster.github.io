DESCRIPTION:Managed programming languages including Java and Scala are ver
 y popular for data analytics and mobile applications. However\, they often
  face challenging issues due to the overhead caused by the automatic memor
 y management to detect and reclaim free available memory. It has been obse
 rved that during their Garbage Collection (GC)\, excessively long pauses c
 an account for up to 40% of the total execution time. Therefore\, mitigati
 ng the GC overhead has been an active research topic to satisfy today's ap
 plication requirements. This paper proposes a new technique called SwapVA 
 to improve data copying in the copying/moving phases of GCs and reduce the
  GC pause time\, thereby mitigating the issue of GC overhead. Our contribu
 tion is twofold. First\, a SwapVA system call is introduced as a zero-copy
  technique to accelerate the GC copying/moving phase. Second\, for the dem
 onstration of its effectiveness\, we have integrated SwapVA into SVAGC as 
 an implementation of scalable Full GC on multi-core systems. Based on our 
 results\, the proposed solutions can dramatically reduce the GC pause in a
 pplications with large objects by as much as 70.9% and 97%\, respectively\
 , in the Sparse.large/4 (one quarter of the default input size) and Sigver
 ify benchmarks.
