DESCRIPTION:Hybrid memory systems are an emerging trend to provide larger 
 RAM sizes at reasonable cost and energy consumption. Recent byte-addressab
 le persistent memory (PMEM) technology offers capacities comparable to sto
 rage devices and access times much closer to DRAMs than other non-volatile
  memory technology. To palliate the large gap with DRAM performance\, DRAM
  and PMEM are usually combined. Users have the choice to either manage all
 ocations to different memory spaces manually or leverage the DRAM as a cac
 he for the virtual address space of the PMEM. In this paper\, we present n
 ovel methodology to address automatic object-level placement\, which addre
 sses the performance shortcomings of a previous solution\, yielding a fram
 ework which is competitive in performance with respect to the state of the
  art\, while enabling a much simpler workflow. Our experiments leveraging 
 Intel Optane Persistent Memory show from matching to greatly improved perf
 ormance with respect to state–of–the–art software and hardware solut
 ions\, attaining over 2x runtime improvement in miniapplications and over 
 6% in OpenFOAM\, a complex production application.
