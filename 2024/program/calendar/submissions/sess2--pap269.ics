DESCRIPTION:Emerging workloads in high-performance computing (HPC) are emb
 racing significant changes\, such as having diverse resource requirements 
 instead of being CPU-centric. This advancement forces cluster schedulers t
 o consider multiple schedulable resources during decision-making. Existing
  scheduling studies rely on heuristic or optimization methods\, which are 
 limited by an inability to adapt to new scenarios for ensuring long-term s
 cheduling performance. We present an intelligent scheduling agent named MR
 Sch for multi-resource scheduling in HPC that leverages direct future pred
 iction (DFP)\, an advanced multi-objective reinforcement learning algorith
 m. While DFP demonstrated outstanding performance in a gaming competition\
 , it has not been previously explored in the context of HPC scheduling. Se
 veral key techniques are developed in this study to tackle the challenges 
 involved in multi-resource scheduling. These techniques enable MRSch to le
 arn an appropriate scheduling policy automatically and dynamically adapt i
 ts policy in response to workload changes via dynamic resource prioritizin
 g. We compare MRSch with existing scheduling methods through extensive tra
 ce-base simulations. Our results demonstrate that MRSch improves schedulin
 g performance by up to 48% compared to the existing scheduling methods.
