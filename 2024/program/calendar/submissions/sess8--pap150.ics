DESCRIPTION:System administrators set default storage system configuration
  parameters with the goal of providing high performance for their system's
  I/O workloads. However\, this generalized configuration can lead to sub-o
 ptimal I/O performance for individual workloads. Users can provide paramet
 er settings to the storage system to obtain better performance for individ
 ual applications\, but it can be very challenging to determine which param
 eters to set and to what values. This problem is even further exacerbated 
 by the increased complexity of modern storage systems. In this work\, we m
 ove towards a solution to this problem by providing a systematic categoriz
 ation of workload-related information that users or middleware libraries c
 an pass to the storage system to optimize I/O performance for the specific
  workloads. We study applications and workflows from different scientific 
 domains to cover a broad range of HPC use-cases. Through our categorizatio
 n\, we find that a) workload features differ based on hardware\, software\
 , and data components involved in the execution of the workloads and b) mu
 ltiple workload features together drive I/O optimizations. Additionally\, 
 the methodology proposed in this work optimizes complex scientific workloa
 ds by 2.2x-8x using workload-aware I/O optimizations. Using the proposed m
 ethodology\, users can pragmatically characterize their workload\, and thi
 s characterization can assist the storage system in configuring itself to 
 optimize I/O performance for individual workloads in HPC systems.
