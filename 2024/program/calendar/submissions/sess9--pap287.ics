DESCRIPTION:Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays (CGRAs) are a class of re
 configurable architectures that inherit the performance and usability of C
 entral Processing Units (CPUs) and the reconfigurability of Field-Programm
 able Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Historically\, CGRAs have been used successfully
  to accelerate embedded applications and are today also being considered t
 o accelerate High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications in future super
 computers. However\, embedded-systems and supercomputers are two different
  domains with different applications and constraints\, and it is today not
  fully understood what CGRA design decisions adequately cater to the HPC m
 arket. One such unknown parameters is regarding the interconnect that faci
 litates intra-CGRA communication. Today\, intra-CGRA communication comes i
 n two flavors: using routers closely embedded into the compute units or us
 ing discrete routers outside the compute units. The former trades flexibil
 ity to reduce hardware cost\, while the latter has greater flexibility wit
 h more resource usage. In this paper\, we investigate which of both design
 s suits the CGRA HPC segment. We extend our previous methodology\, which c
 onsists of both a parameterized CGRA design and an OpenMP-capable compiler
 \, to accommodate both types of routing designs\, including verification t
 ests using RTL simulation. Our results show that the discrete router desig
 n can facilitate better use of processing elements (PEs) compared to embed
 ded routers and achieve between 81.25% to 26.39% reduction in unnecessary 
 PE occupancy for a aggressively unrolled stencil kernel on a 18 x 16 CGRA 
 at a (estimated) interconnect resource overhead by 6.3x. This reduction in
  PE occupancy can be used to exploit instruction-level parallelism (ILP) t
 hrough even more aggressive unrolling.
