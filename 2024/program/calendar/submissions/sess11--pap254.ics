DESCRIPTION:Development of environments for distributed systems is a tedio
 us and time-consuming iterative process. The reproducibility of such envir
 onments is a crucial factor for rigorous scientific contributions. We thin
 k that being able to smoothly test environments both locally and on a targ
 et distributed platform makes development cycles faster and reduces the fr
 iction to adopt better experimental practices. To address this issue\, thi
 s paper introduces the notion of environment transposition and implements 
 it in NixOS Compose\, a tool that generates reproducible distributed envir
 onments. It enables users to deploy their environments on virtualized (doc
 ker\, QEMU) or physical (Grid'5000) platforms with the same unique descrip
 tion of the environment. We show that NixOS Compose enables to build repro
 ducible environments without overhead by comparing it to state-of-the-art 
 solutions for the generation of distributed environments (EnOSlib and Kame
 leon). NixOS Compose actually enables substantial performance improvements
  on image building time over Kameleon (up to 11x faster for initial builds
  and up to 19x faster when building a variation of an existing environment
 ).
