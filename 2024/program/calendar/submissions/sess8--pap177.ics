DESCRIPTION:Extracting actionable information from data produced by instru
 ments such as the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS-II) and Advanced Photo
 n Source Upgrade (APS-U) is becoming more challenging due to the fast-grow
 ing data generation rate. The rapid analysis possible with ML methods can 
 enable fast feedback loops that can be used to adjust experimental setups 
 in real time\, for example when errors occur or interesting events are det
 ected. However\, to avoid degradation in ML performance over time due to c
 hanges in an instrument or sample\, we need a way to update ML models rapi
 dly while an experiment is running. We present here a data service and mod
 el service to accelerate deep neural network training with a focus on ML-b
 ased scientific applications. Our proposed data service achieves 100x spee
 dup in terms of data labelling compare to the current state-of-the-art. Fu
 rther\, our model service achieve up to 200x improvement in training speed
 . Overall\, fairDMS achieves up to 92x speedup in-terms of end-to-end mode
 l updating time.
