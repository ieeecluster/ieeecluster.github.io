DESCRIPTION:Diagnosing causes of performance variations in High-Performanc
 e Computing (HPC) systems is a daunting challenge due to the systems' scal
 e and complexity. Variations in application performance result in prematur
 e job termination\, lower energy efficiency\, or wasted computing resource
 s. One potential solution is manual root-cause analysis based on system te
 lemetry data. However\, this approach has become an increasingly time-cons
 uming procedure as the process relies on human expertise and the size of t
 elemetry data is voluminous. Recent research employs supervised machine le
 arning (ML) models to diagnose previously encountered performance anomalie
 s in compute nodes automatically. However\, these models generally necessi
 tate vast amounts of labeled samples that represent anomalous and healthy 
 states of an application during training. This demand for labeled samples 
 is constraining because gathering labeled samples is difficult and costly\
 , especially considering anomalies that occur infrequently. This paper pro
 poses a novel active learning-based framework that diagnoses previously en
 countered performance anomalies in HPC systems using significantly fewer l
 abeled samples compared to state-of-the-art ML-based frameworks. Our frame
 work combines an active learning-based query strategy and a supervised cla
 ssifier to minimize the number of labeled samples required to achieve a ta
 rget performance score. We evaluate our framework on a production HPC syst
 em and a testbed HPC cluster using real and proxy applications. We show th
 at our framework\, ALBADross\, achieves a 0.95 F1-score using 28x fewer la
 beled samples compared to a supervised approach with equal F1-score\, even
  when there are previously unseen applications and application inputs in t
 he test dataset.
