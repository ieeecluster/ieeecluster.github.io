DESCRIPTION:Distributed data storage services tailored to specific applica
 tions have grown popular in the high-performance computing (HPC) community
  as a way to address I/O and storage challenges. These services offer a va
 riety of specific interfaces\, semantics\, and data representations. They 
 also expose many tuning parameters\, making it difficult for their users t
 o find the best configuration for a given workload and platform. To addres
 s this issue\, we develop a novel variational-autoencoder-guided asynchron
 ous Bayesian optimization method to tune HPC storage service parameters. O
 ur approach uses transfer learning to leverage prior tuning results and us
 e a dynamically updated surrogate model to explore the large parameter sea
 rch space in a systematic way. We implement our approach within the DeepHy
 per open-source framework\, and apply it to the autotuning of a high-energ
 y physics workflow on Argonne's Theta supercomputer. We show that our tran
 sfer-learning approach enables a more than 40x search speedup over random 
 search\, compared with a 2.5x to 10x speedup when not using transfer learn
 ing. Additionally\, we show that our approach is on par with state-of-the-
 art autotuning frameworks in speed and outperforms them in resource utiliz
 ation and parallelization capabilities.
