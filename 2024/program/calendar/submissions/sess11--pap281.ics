DESCRIPTION:Sparse matrix multiplication (SpGEMM) is a fundamental kernel 
 used in many diverse application areas\, both numerical and discrete. For 
 example\, many algebraic graph algorithms rely on SpGEMM in the tropical s
 emiring to compute shortest paths in graphs. Recently\, SpGEMM has receive
 d growing attention regarding implementations for specific (parallel) arch
 itectures. Yet\, this concerns only the static problem\, where both input 
 matrices do not change. In many applications\, however\, matrices (or thei
 r corresponding graphs) change over time. Although recomputing from scratc
 h is very expensive\, we are not aware of any dynamic SpGEMM algorithms in
  the literature. In this paper\, we thus propose a batch-dynamic algorithm
  for MPI-based parallel computing. Building on top of a distributed graph/
 matrix data structure that allows for fast updates\, our dynamic SpGEMM re
 duces the communication volume significantly. It does so by exploiting tha
 t updates change far fewer matrix entries than there are non-zeros in the 
 input operands. Our experiments with popular benchmark graphs show that ou
 r approach pays off. For batches of insertions or removals of matrix entri
 es\, our dynamic SpGEMM is substantially faster than the static algorithms
  in the state-of-the-art competitors CombBLAS\, CTF and PETSc.
