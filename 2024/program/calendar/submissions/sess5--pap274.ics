DESCRIPTION:In the context of parallel applications\, communication is a c
 ritical part of the infrastructure and a potential bottleneck. The traditi
 onal approach to tackle communication challenges consists of redesigning a
 lgorithms so that the complexity or the communication volume is reduced. H
 owever\, there are algorithms like the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) where 
 reducing the volume of communication is very challenging but holds promise
  because it can lead to a large benefit in terms of time-to-completion. In
  this paper\, we revisit the implementation of the MPI all-to-all routine 
 at the core of 3D FFTs by using advanced MPI features\, such as One-Sided 
 Communication\, and integrate data compression during communication to red
 uce the volume of data exchanged. Since some compression techniques are 
 ’lossy’ in the sense that they involve a loss of accuracy\, we study t
 he impact of lossy compression in heFFTe\, the state-of-the-art FFT librar
 y for large scale 3D FFTs on hybrid architectures with GPUs. Consequently\
 , we design an approximate FFT algorithm that trades off user-controlled a
 ccuracy for speed. We show that we speedup the 3D FFTs proportionally to t
 he compression rate. In terms of accuracy\, comparing our approach with a 
 reduced precision execution\, where both the data and the computation are 
 in reduced precision\, we show that when the volume of communication is co
 mpressed to the size of the reduced precision data\, the approximate FFT a
 lgorithm is as fast as the one in reduced precision while the accuracy is 
 one order of magnitude better.
