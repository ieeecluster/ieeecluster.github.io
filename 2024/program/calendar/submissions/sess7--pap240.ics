DESCRIPTION:The current practice for fusion scientists running first princ
 iple simulations on high performance computing platforms is to either run 
 their simulations and output their data for post-hoc analysis\, or to plac
 e in situ analytics into their code. In this paper we examine a complex wo
 rkflow using XGC fusions simulation run on the Oak Ridge Leadership Comput
 ing Facility's supercomputer Summit\, which also involve three analyses as
  part of the results necessary for scientific discovery. We discuss the ch
 allenges faced when implementing these algorithms and present an original 
 hybrid staging technique to help enable the physicists to make discoveries
  during the execution of the simulation. By creating this infrastructure\,
  we can examine complicated physics results\, which may not have been poss
 ible without the infrastructure. For example\, our work enables the online
  visualization of turbulent homoclinic tangle around the magnetic X-point\
 , breaking the last confinement surface. This visualization could help fus
 ion scientists to better understand and improve the turbulence spread of p
 lasma exhaust heat\, which is crucial toward realizing plasmas beyond the 
 currently accessible physics regimes of present-day tokamak reactors. The 
 physics of turbulent homoclinic tangle will be reported in a future physic
 s publication\, by utilizing the original online analysis/visualization fr
 amework presented in this paper.
