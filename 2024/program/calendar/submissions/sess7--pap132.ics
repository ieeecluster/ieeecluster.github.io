DESCRIPTION:The ability to track simulated cancer cells through the circul
 atory system\, important for developing a mechanistic understanding of met
 astatic spread\, pushes the limits of todayâ€™s supercomputers by requirin
 g the simulation of large fluid volumes at cellular-scale resolution. To o
 vercome this challenge\, we introduce a new adaptive physics refinement (A
 PR) method that captures cellular-scale interaction across large domains a
 nd leverages a hybrid CPU-GPU approach to maximize performance. Through al
 gorithmic advances that integrate multi-physics and multi-resolution model
 s\, we establish a finely resolved window with explicitly modeled cells co
 upled to a coarsely resolved bulk fluid domain. In this work we present mu
 ltiple validations of the APR framework by comparing against fully resolve
 d fluid-structure interaction methods and employ techniques\, such as late
 ncy hiding and maximizing memory bandwidth\, to effectively utilize hetero
 geneous node architectures. Collectively\, these computational development
 s and performance optimizations provide a robust and scalable framework to
  enable system-level simulations of cancer cell transport.
