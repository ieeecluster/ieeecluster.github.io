DESCRIPTION:A major challenge of memory analysis tools is combining high-r
 esolution analysis and low overhead measurement. Currently\, hardware/soft
 ware-based analysis of load-level sequences incurs time slowdowns of O(100
 ×). We present MemGaze\, a tool for low-overhead\, high-resolution memory
  analysis. MemGaze uses Intel’s Processor Tracing (PT) instruction ptwri
 te to collect sampled and compressed memory address traces for load-level\
 , sequence-aware analysis of data reuse. We describe multi-resolution anal
 ysis for locations vs. operations\, accesses vs. spatio-temporal reuse\, a
 nd reuse (distance\, rate\, volume) vs. access patterns. Both trace size a
 nd resolution are controllable. We use MemGaze to elucidate the memory eff
 ects of different data structures and algorithms. For sampled traces that 
 are ≈1% of a full one\, analysis metrics have 1-25% MAPE for histograms 
 of varying dynamic sequence lengths. With current suboptimal kernel suppor
 t (PT runs continuously)\, MemGaze’s time overhead is typically 10–95%
 \; 7× at worst. However\, when PT runs only during samples\, overhead is 
 10–35% on memory intensive regions and correlates with executed ptwrites
 .
