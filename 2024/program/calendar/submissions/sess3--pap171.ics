DESCRIPTION:Deadlock is one of the common problems in the message passing 
 interface. At present\, most methods for detecting MPI deadlocks rely on e
 xhausting all execution paths of a program\, which is inefficient. In addi
 tion\, the number of execution paths increases exponentially with the numb
 er of wildcard receive events and processes\, further worsening the situat
 ion. To alleviate the problem\, we propose a deadlock detection approach b
 ased on match-sets to avoid exploring execution paths. With this approach\
 , a match detection rule is raised to form the rough match-sets based on L
 azy Lamport Clocks Protocol\, then in order to refine the match-sets\, thr
 ee refining algorithms are presented according to the non-overtaking rule 
 and MPI communication mechanism\, finally deadlocks are detected by analyz
 ing the refined match-sets. We have implemented a tool called SAMPI and pe
 rformed experimental evaluation on 27 programs. The experimental results s
 how that SAMPI is efficient to detect deadlocks in MPI programs\, especial
 ly to handle programs with many interleavings.
