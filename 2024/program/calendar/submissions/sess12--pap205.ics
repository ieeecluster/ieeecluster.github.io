DESCRIPTION:Recently\, pipeline parallelism has been widely used in traini
 ng of large DNN models. However\, there are still two main challenges for 
 efficient pipeline parallelism: i) a balanced model partition is crucial f
 or the pipeline efficiency\, whereas prior works lack a sound solution to 
 automatically generate a balanced partition. ii) the startup overhead is i
 nevitable and especially significant for deep pipelines\, which is an impo
 rtant source of pipeline bubbles and severely affects pipeline scalability
 . We propose AutoPipe to solve this two problems\, which contains i) a pla
 nner for automatically and quickly generating a balanced pipeline partitio
 n scheme\, with a fine-grained partitioner. This partitioner groups DNN in
  the sub-layer granularity and finds the balanced scheme with a heuristic 
 search algorithm\; and ii) a micro-batch slicer that reduces pipeline star
 tup overhead according to the Planner results by splitting the micro-batch
  evenly. This slicer automatically solves an appropriate number of micro-b
 atches to split. The experimental results show that AutoPipe can accelerat
 e training by up to 1.30x over the state-of-the-art distributed training f
 ramework Megatron-LM\, with 50% reduction in startup overhead and an order
 -of-magnitude reduction in pipeline planning time. Furthermore\, AutoPipe 
 Planner improves the partition balance by 2.73x-12.7x compared to DAPPLE P
 lanner and Piper.
