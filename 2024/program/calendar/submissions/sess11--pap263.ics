DESCRIPTION:Integrating recent advancements in resilient algorithms and te
 chniques into existing codes is a singular challenge in fault tolerance 
 – in part due to the underlying complexity of implementing resilience in
  the first place\, but also due to the difficulty introduced when attempti
 ng to integrate the functionality of a standalone new strategy with the pr
 eexisting resilience layers of an application. We propose that the solutio
 n does not rest in building integrated solutions for users\, but in runtim
 es designed to integrate into a larger comprehensive resilience system and
  thereby enabling the necessary jump to multi-layered recovery. Our work d
 esigns\, implements\, and verifies one such comprehensive system of runtim
 es. Utilizing Fenix\, a process resilience tool with integration into pree
 xisting resilience systems as a design priority\, we update Resilient Kokk
 os and the use pattern of VeloC to support application-level integration o
 f resilience runtimes. Our work shows that designing integrable systems ra
 ther than integrated systems allows for user designed optimization and upg
 rading of resilience techniques while maintaining the simplicity and perfo
 rmance of all-in-one resilience solutions. More application-specific choic
 e in resilience strategies allows for better long-term flexibility\, perfo
 rmance\, and — importantly — simplicity.
