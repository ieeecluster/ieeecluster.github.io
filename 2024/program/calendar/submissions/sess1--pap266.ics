DESCRIPTION:The enormous volume of data generated by large-scale instrumen
 ts and simulations poses significant challenges in archiving\, transferrin
 g\, sharing and analyzing data for various scientific groups. Lossy reduct
 ion techniques are vital to reduce dataset size to acceptable levels. Howe
 ver\, putting more information content per bit\, increases the severity of
  loss if perturbed by malicious users or hardware failures. In the worst c
 ase\, the entire dataset is compromised. Malevolent alteration or destruct
 ion of datasets containing crucial discoveries can completely invalidate r
 esearch outcomes in scientific studies. Therefore\, it is critical to inte
 grate compression and encryption to handle data securely and efficiently. 
 The current state-of-the-art combination technique Cmpr-Encr handles compr
 ession and encryption as two distinct processes. This reduces the compress
 ion ratio and bandwidth\, especially for hard-to-compress datasets. In thi
 s paper\, we propose two data protection strategies that work in conjuncti
 on with the lossy compressor SZ: Quantization-only and Huffman-only\, and 
 carefully evaluate the overhead they introduce on compression bandwidth an
 d ratio. Based on the results of testing with real-world scientific datase
 ts\, we find that the cost of Quantization-only varies with the dataset's 
 properties and requires cautious selection. Huffman-only is able to mainta
 in more than 99% of the original compression ratio while saving 6.5% in co
 mpression time compared to SZ. Applying Cmpr-Encr leads to a reduction in 
 compression bandwidth\, whereas Huffman-only increases bandwidth by 3.1% o
 ver the SZ\, on average.
