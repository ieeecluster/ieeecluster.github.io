DESCRIPTION:Silent data corruption poses a significant risk to the integri
 ty of data in storage systems. Although error correction codes (ECC) can r
 ecover the majority of such errors\, a non-negligible portion of them esca
 pe ECC\, referred as uncorrectable errors (UEs). Despite being rare in nat
 ure\, increasing scale of storage systems and fast-growing I/O rates decre
 ased the mean time between UEs from months to hours. Yet\, unlike disk fai
 lures\, UEs are hard to predict with high precision\, making it difficult 
 to use proactive measurements due to considerable overhead to system and a
 pplication performance. In this paper\, we introduce a probabilistic appro
 ach to deploy UE mitigation strategies (e.g.\, write verification\, data s
 crubbing\, etc.) while keeping the system overhead at a tolerable range. T
 o achieve this\, we first estimate the probability of I/O operations to be
  exposed to UEs and determine a subset of disks for which employing UE avo
 idance strategies can lower the UE probability to a desired range. Through
  extensive simulations\, we demonstrate that when proposed probabilistic m
 odel is used to implement \\emph{write verification} strategy to detect an
 d recover from UEs\, more than $50\\%$ of all write-triggered UEs can be a
 voided with $1\\%$ read overhead\, and more than $70\\%$ of UEs can be mit
 igated with less than $3.5\\%$ read overhead. We further measure the impac
 t of read overhead on write performance in production Lustre and Spectrum 
 Scale file systems and validate our finding that that more than $50\\%$ of
  UEs can be avoided with less than $0.2-0.9\\%$ decrease in write throughp
 ut.
