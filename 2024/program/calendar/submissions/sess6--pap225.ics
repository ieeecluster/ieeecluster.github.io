DESCRIPTION:Nowadays\, scientists migrate workflow applications on serverl
 ess Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms in a form of so called function
  choreographies (FCs) to benefit from FaaS high elasticity and instantly s
 pawning numerous functions. However\, the heterogeneous nature of federate
 d FaaS overburdens decisions for the most appropriate configuration setup.
  Unfortunately\, related work mainly support either (i) scheduling algorit
 hms for serverful workflow applications that run on virtual machines or (i
 i) container-based algorithms to schedule individual serverless functions 
 on specific container (executor). Either approach is hard to implement for
  FCs in federated FaaS\; the former due to specifics of the FaaS resource 
 model\, while the latter because they are primarily focused on bag of func
 tions and reducing startup latency down to microseconds. Such optimization
  is negligible for scientific FCs whose functions may run hundreds of seco
 nds due to enormous compute and I/O operations to distributed cloud storag
 e. Instead\, scientific FCs would benefit from schedulers that select the 
 appropriate FaaS provider\, cloud region\, and memory settings. To bridge 
 this gap in scheduling scientific FCs in federated FaaS\, this paper intro
 duces FaaSt\, a novel listbased FC scheduler that optimizes makespan of an
  FC that runs functions across multiple FaaS providers. The evaluation wit
 h three other schedulers showed that FaaSt overcomes limitations of a sing
 le FaaS region and generates speedup of up to 2.82× when running FCs acro
 ss four cloud regions compared to a single region. Moreover\, the FaaSt FC
  scheduler achieves speedup of up to 1.74× compared to the other state-of
 -the-art FC schedulers across the same four regions.
