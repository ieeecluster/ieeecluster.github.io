DESCRIPTION:The need for load balancing in applications with irregular par
 allelism has motivated research on work stealing. An important choice in w
 ork-stealing schedulers is between child stealing or continuation stealing
 . In child stealing\, a newly created task is made stealable by other proc
 essors\, whereas in continuation stealing\, the caller's continuation is m
 ade stealable by executing the newly created task first\, which preserves 
 the serial execution order. Although the benefits of continuation stealing
  have been demonstrated on shared memory by Cilk and other runtime systems
 \, it is rarely employed on distributed memory\, presumably because it has
  been thought to be difficult to implement and inefficient as it involves 
 migration of call stacks across nodes. Akiyama and Taura recently introduc
 ed efficient RDMA-based continuation stealing\, but the practicality of di
 stributed continuation stealing is still unclear because a comparison of i
 ts performance with that of child stealing has not previously been perform
 ed. This paper presents the results of a comparative performance analysis 
 of continuation stealing and child stealing on distributed memory. To clar
 ify the full potential of continuation stealing\, we first investigated va
 rious RDMA-based synchronization (task join) implementations\, which had n
 ot previously been fully investigated. The results revealed that\, when th
 e task synchronization pattern was complicated\, continuation stealing per
 formed better than child stealing despite its relatively long steal latenc
 y due to stack migration. Notably\, our runtime system achieved almost per
 fect scaling on 110\,592 cores in an unbalanced tree search (UTS) benchmar
 k. This scalability is comparable to or even better than that of state-of-
 the-art bag-of-tasks counterparts.
