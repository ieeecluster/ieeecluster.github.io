DESCRIPTION:General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) has a wide range of appli
 cations in scientific simulation and artificial intelligence. Although tra
 ditional libraries can achieve high performance on large regular-shaped GE
 MMs\, they often behave not well on irregular-shaped GEMMs\, which are oft
 en found in new algorithms and applications of high-performance computing 
 (HPC). Due to energy efficiency constraints\, low-power multi-core digital
  signal processors (DSPs) have become an alternative architecture in HPC s
 ystems. Targeting multi-core DSPs in FT-m7032\, a prototype CPU-DSPs heter
 ogeneous processor for HPC\, an efficient implementation - ftIMM - for thr
 ee types of irregular-shaped GEMMs is proposed. FtIMM supports automatic g
 eneration of assembly micro-kernels\, two parallelization strategies\, and
  auto-tuning of block sizes and parallelization strategies. The experiment
 s show that ftIMM can get better performance than the traditional GEMM imp
 lementations on multi-core DSPs in FT-m7032\, yielding on up to 7.2x perfo
 rmance improvement\, when performing on irregular-shaped GEMMs. And ftIMM 
 on multi-core DSPs can also far outperform the open source library on mult
 i-core CPUs in FT-m7032\, delivering up to 30.7x higher performance.
