DESCRIPTION:In data center networks\, applications such as distributed key
 -value stores consume a lot of CPU resources. The performance of the entir
 e system drops significantly under heavy load conditions. In order to impr
 ove the performance of key-value stores\, many existing studies use RDMA (
 Remote Direct Memory Access) to reduce the communication overhead. However
 \, RDMA primitives can only offload simple operations to the NIC\, such as
  reading and writing remote memory. With the emergence of new hardware lik
 e SmartNICs\, we consider whether we can offload more complex operations i
 n distributed key-value store to SmartNICs to reduce the load on CPU.In th
 is paper we present SKV\, a SmartNIC-offloaded distributed key-value store
 . In order to make full use of the offload ability of the SmartNIC\, We ma
 ke a detailed analysis on the characteristic and architecture of SmartNIC 
 and distributed key-value store. SKV offloads operations such as data repl
 ication to the SmartNIC. We design a new replication mechanism\, which ena
 bles the server to separate background processing from the interaction wit
 h clients in the front. We implement SKV with Mellanox BlueField SmartNIC.
  Our evaluations show that SKV improves the overall throughput by 14% and 
 reduces latency by 21% compared with baseline.
