DESCRIPTION:Early but promising results in quantum computing have been ena
 bled by the concurrent development of quantum algorithms\, devices\, and m
 aterials. Classical simulation of quantum programs has enabled the design 
 and analysis of algorithms and implementation strategies targeting current
  and anticipated quantum device architectures. In this paper\, we present 
 a graph-based approach to achieving efficient quantum circuit simulation. 
 Our approach involves partitioning the graph representation of a given qua
 ntum circuit into acyclic subgraphs/circuits that exhibit better data loca
 lity. Simulation of each sub-circuit is organized hierarchically\, with th
 e iterative construction and simulation of smaller state vectors\, improvi
 ng overall performance. Also\, this partitioning reduces the number of pas
 ses through data\, improving the total computation time. We present three 
 partitioning strategies and observe that acyclic graph partitioning typica
 lly results in the best time-to-solution. In contrast\, other strategies r
 educe the partitioning time at the expense of potentially increased simula
 tion times. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our 
 approach.
