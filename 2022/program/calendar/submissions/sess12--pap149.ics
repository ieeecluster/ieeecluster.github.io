DESCRIPTION:Scientific communities are increasingly adopting deep learning
  (DL) models in their applications to accelerate scientific discovery proc
 esses. However\, with rapid growth in the computing capabilities of HPC su
 percomputers\, large-scale DL applications have to spend a significant por
 tion of training time performing I/O to a parallel storage system. Previou
 s research works have investigated optimization techniques such as prefetc
 hing and caching. Unfortunately\, there exist non- trivial challenges to a
 dopting the existing solutions on HPC supercomputers for large-scale DL tr
 aining applications\, which include nonperformance and/or failures at extr
 eme scale\, lack of portability and generality in design\, complex deploym
 ent methodology\, and being limited to a specific application or dataset. 
 To address these challenges\, we propose High-Velocity AI Cache (HVAC)\, a
  distributed read-cache layer that targets and fully exploits the node-loc
 al storage or near node-local storage technology. HVAC seamlessly accelera
 tes read I/O by aggregating node-local or near node-local storage\, avoidi
 ng metadata lookups and file locking while preserving portability in the a
 pplication code. We deploy and evaluate HVAC on 1024 nodes (with over 6000
  NVIDIA V100 GPUS) of the Summit supercomputer. In particular\, we evaluat
 e the scalability\, efficiency\, accuracy\, and load distribution of HVAC 
 compared to GPFS and XFS- on-NVMe. With four different DL applications\, w
 e observe an average 25% performance improvement atop GPFS and 9% drop aga
 inst XFS-on-NVMe\, which scale linearly and are considered the performance
  upper bound. We envision HVAC as an important caching library for upcomin
 g HPC supercomputers such as Frontier.
