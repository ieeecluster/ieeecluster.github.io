DESCRIPTION:Collective operations are widely used by MPI applications to r
 ealize their communication patterns. Their efficiency is crucial for both 
 performance and scalability of parallel applications. For deriving efficie
 nt MPI implementations\, significant effort is put to keep pace with advan
 ces and capabilities of the underlying hardware and interconnect. Recent p
 rocessor advances have led to nodes with higher core counts and complex in
 ternal structures and memory hierarchies. Such nodes are able to host tens
  to hundreds of processes and thus\, performance of MPI collectives at the
  intra-node level becomes critical. In this work\, we propose a framework 
 for collective operations at the intra-node level\, that aims to lower lat
 ency and increased bandwidth. Our approach utilizes knowledge of internal 
 node structure to construct hierarchical algorithms\, and XPMEM to achieve
  single-copy transfers. Pipelining is used to overlap communication at dif
 ferent levels of the hierarchy. We evaluate the proposed approach through 
 several microbenchmarks and real-world MPI applications. For evaluation pu
 rposes\, we compare the proposed approach with implementations of similar 
 schemes from two recent studies. Our evaluation with microbenchmarks for B
 roadcast and Allreduce shows speedup up to 2.5x and 3x\, respectively\, ov
 er UCC and OpenMPI's default collectives implementation. Compared to recen
 t research studies\, we improve Broadcast by up to 5x\, and Allreduce by u
 p to 7x. We reduce the time of three applications -- PiSvM\, miniAMR and C
 NTK\, by up to 12%\, 52% and 12%\, respectively\, over the next best-perfo
 rming alternative.
