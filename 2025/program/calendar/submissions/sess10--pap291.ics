DESCRIPTION:The hierarchical matrices (H-matrices) are robust methods for 
 approximating the dense matrices that appear in the Boundary Element Metho
 d (BEM). In order to accelerate solving linear systems using an iterative 
 method in the BEM\, it is essential to speed up the matrix-vector multipli
 cation in the iterative linear solver. However\, compared with the case of
  dense or sparse matrices\, there are not enough studies on speeding up th
 e Hierarchical Matrix-Vector multiplication (HiMV). The HiMV algorithm con
 sists of the multiplication of a number of sub-matrices and vectors\, but 
 it is not clear how these should be implemented for acceleration. This pap
 er discusses optimization methodologies of HiMV for modern multi-core CPUs
 \, such as the H-matrix storage method for efficient memory access\, avoid
 ance method of write contention during reduction operations on the solutio
 n vector\, inter-thread load balancing\, and blocking and sub-matrix sorti
 ng methods for cache efficiency. As a result\, we demonstrate these optimi
 zations significantly impact on the performance of modern CPU-based superc
 omputers. For instance\, we assumed that the best performance to aim for i
 s the performance of dense matrix vector multiplication (GEMV) and obtaine
 d 84.8%\, 100.7%\, and 98.7% performance of the GEMV Flops in single-socke
 t runs on A64FX\, AMD EPYC\, and Intel Xeon Cascade Lake\, respectively. W
 e found that optimization for better memory performance and cache efficien
 cy is especially important for the A64FX with high- speed HBM2 memory.
