DESCRIPTION:Virtualized network has become the cornerstone of today's larg
 e-scale cloud data centers. In particular\, the data plane of virtualized 
 network\, consisting of virtual switch\, virtual router and other software
  network functionalities\, performs all network packets processing of virt
 ual machines (VMs). However\, current virtualized data plane solutions inc
 ur drastic performance interference with co-resident VMs\, and thus suffer
  from unpredictable network performance\, especially in terms of tail late
 ncy. In this work\, we show that the performance issue stems from the fact
  that CPU plays a dual role of both communication and computation in virtu
 alized networks. A number of virtual network components and their complex 
 packets processing create an undue burden on the hosts' CPUs and in turn c
 ause the mutual performance interference among VMs and networks. To addres
 s this issue\, we present a multipath data plane solution\, where the traf
 fic of VMs can be adaptively and seamlessly offloaded to the adjacent host
 s. At the core of this design is to optimize the VM traffic allocation amo
 ng multiple paths. We formulate the VM multipath traffic allocation proble
 m with coupled variables of computing and network resources\, which were o
 nly considered as mutually independent in prior researches. Then we presen
 t a distributed algorithm to efficiently solve the large-scale\, inter-dep
 endent global optimization problem\, with convergence and optimality guara
 ntees. Through extensive simulations and real-world testbed experiments\, 
 we show that our solution delivers consistent performance improvement (up 
 to 6.7 times improvement in aggregate throughput and 21.4 times reduction 
 in tail latency\, respectively) in the dynamic cloud system.
