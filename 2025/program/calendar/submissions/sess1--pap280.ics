DESCRIPTION:In this paper\, we present a framework for moving compute and 
 data between processing elements in a distributed heterogeneous system. Th
 e implementation of the framework is based on the LLVM compiler toolchain 
 combined with the UCX communication framework. The framework can generate 
 binary machine code or LLVM bitcode for multiple CPU architectures and mov
 e the code to remote machines while dynamically optimizing and linking the
  code on the target platform. The remotely injected code can recursively p
 ropagate itself to other remote machines or generate new code. The goal of
  this paper is threefold: (a) to present an architecture and implementatio
 n of the framework that provides essential infrastructure to program a new
  class of disaggregated systems wherein heterogeneous programming elements
  such as compute nodes and data processing units (DPUs) are distributed ac
 ross the system\, (b) to demonstrate how the framework can be integrated w
 ith modern\, high-level programming languages such as Julia\, and (c) to d
 emonstrate and evaluate a new class of eXtended Remote Direct Memory Acces
 s (X-RDMA) communication operations that are enabled by this framework. To
  evaluate the capabilities of the framework\, we used a cluster with Fujit
 su CPUs and as well as heterogeneous cluster with Intel CPUs and BlueField
 -2 DPUs interconnected using high-performance RDMA fabric. We demonstrated
  an X-RDMA pointer chase application that outperforms an RDMA GET-based im
 plementation by 70% and is as fast as Active Messages\, but does not requi
 re function predeployment on remote platforms.
