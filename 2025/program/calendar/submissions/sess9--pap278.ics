DESCRIPTION:With the democratization of the Cloud paradigm\, many applicat
 ions are developed to be executed inside virtual machines hosted by remote
  data centers providing an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). These appli
 cations\, developed by different users with different goals\, tend to have
  different behaviors\, hence a similar treatment on the Cloud provider sid
 e seems to be sub-optimal. Indeed\, VM are black boxes to which are attach
 ed vCPUs\, whose frequency are all the same\, and are mainly indicative. I
 n our opinion\, an important limitation can be noted here. Because the Clo
 ud provider is unaware of the applications that are executed inside the VM
 s\, it has little insight on the behavior of the applications\, and how to
  manage the VMs. For these reasons\, Cloud provider can assign too much or
  too few resources to a VM\, and might rely on migration mechanism to cope
  with that problem. In this paper\, we propose to attach a virtual frequen
 cy to the VM template\, which can be configured by the customer to better 
 describe her expected application requirements\, and the associated qualit
 y of service. Then\, to enforce this virtual frequency\, we designed a con
 troller that leverages the Linux cgroup system to dynamically adjust the c
 onfiguration on the host machine. We evaluate our new controller on a real
  infrastructure with real CPU-intensive applications executed by VM with d
 ifferent frequencies. We also discuss the benefits of our virtual frequenc
 y capping for VM placement.
