DESCRIPTION:Partitioning a graph into balanced blocks such that few edges 
 run between blocks is a key problem for large-scale distributed processing
 . In this work\, we present a shared-memory streaming multi-recursive part
 itioning scheme that performs recursive multi-sections on the fly without 
 knowing the overall input graph to compute hierarchical partitionings. If 
 a hierarchy is not specified as an input\, our approach can also be used a
 s a tool to solve the standard graph partitioning problem. Our approach ha
 s a considerably lower running time complexity in comparison with state-of
 -the-art non-buffered one-pass partitioning algorithms designed for the no
 n-hierarchical graph partitioning case. Moreover\, if the topology of a di
 stributed system is known\, it is possible to further optimize the communi
 cation costs by mapping partitions onto processing elements. Our experimen
 ts indicate that our algorithm is both faster and produces better process 
 mappings than competing tools. In case of graph partitioning\, our framewo
 rk is up to two orders of magnitude faster at the cost of 5% more cut edge
 s compared to Fennel.
