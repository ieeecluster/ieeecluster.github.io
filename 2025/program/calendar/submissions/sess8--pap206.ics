DESCRIPTION:Parallel file systems are at the core of HPC I/O infrastructur
 es. Those systems minimize the I/O time of applications by separating file
 s into fixed-size chunks and distributing them across multiple storage tar
 gets. Therefore\, the I/O performance experienced with a PFS is directly l
 inked to the capacity of retrieving these chunks in parallel. In this work
 \, we conduct an in-depth evaluation of the impact of the stripe count (th
 e number of targets used for striping) on the write performance of BeeGFS\
 , one of the most popular parallel file systems today. We consider differe
 nt network configurations and show the fundamental role played by this par
 ameter\, in addition to the number of compute nodes\, processes and storag
 e targets. Through a rigorous experimental evaluation\, we directly contra
 dict conclusions from related work. Notably\, we show that sharing I/O tar
 gets does not lead to performance degradation and that applications should
  use as many storage targets as possible. Our recommendations have the pot
 ential to significantly improve the overall write performance of BeeGFS de
 ployments\, and also provide valuable information for future work on stora
 ge target allocation and stripe count tuning.
