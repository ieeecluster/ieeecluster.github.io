DESCRIPTION:Runtime systems are commonly used by parallel applications in 
 order to efficiently exploit the underlying hardware resources. A runtime 
 system hides the complexity of the management of the hardware and exposes 
 a high-level interface to application developers. To this end\, it makes d
 ecisions by relying on heuristics that estimate the future behavior of the
  application. In this paper\, we propose Pythia\, a library that serves as
  an oracle capable of predicting the future behavior of an application\, s
 o that the runtime system can make more informed decisions. Pythia builds 
 on the deterministic nature of many HPC applications: by recording an exec
 ution trace\, Pythia captures the application main behavior. The trace can
  be provided for future executions of the application\, and a runtime syst
 em can ask for predictions of future program behavior. We evaluate Pythia 
 on 13 MPI applications and show that Pythia can accurately predict the fut
 ure of most of these applications\, even when varying the problem size. We
  demonstrate how Pythia predictions can guide a runtime system optimizatio
 n by implementing an adaptive thread parallelism strategy in GNU OpenMP ru
 ntime system. The evaluation shows that\, thanks to Pythia prediction\, th
 e adaptive strategy reduces the execution time of an application by up to 
 38%.
