DESCRIPTION:MPI collective communication is an omnipresent communication m
 odel for High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. The performance of a co
 llective operation depends strongly on the algorithm used to implement it.
  MPI libraries use inaccurate heuristics to select these algorithms\, caus
 ing applications to suffer unnecessary slowdowns. Machine learning (ML)-ba
 sed autotuners are a promising alternative. ML autotuners can intelligentl
 y select algorithms for individual jobs\, resulting in near-optimal perfor
 mance. However\, these approaches currently spend more time training than 
 they save by accelerating applications\, rendering them impractical. We ma
 ke the case that ML-based collective algorithm selection autotuners can be
  made practical and accelerate production applications on large-scale supe
 rcomputers. We identify multiple impracticalities in the existing work\, s
 uch as slow training point selection and ignoring non-power-of-two feature
  values. We address these challenges through variance-based point selectio
 n and model testing alongside topology-aware benchmark parallelization. Ou
 r approach minimizes training time by eliminating unnecessary training poi
 nts and maximizing machine utilization. We incorporate our improvements in
 to a prototype active learning system\, ACCLAiM (Advancing Collective Comm
 unication (L) Autotuning using Machine Learning). We show that each of ACC
 LAiMâ€™s advancements significantly reduce training time compared to the b
 est existing machine learning approach. Then\, we apply ACCLAiM on a leade
 rship-class supercomputer and demonstrate the conditions where ACCLAiM can
  accelerate HPC applications\, provide the advantage of ML autotuners in a
  production setting for the first time.
