<h2 id="travel-and-local-transportation">Travel and Local Transportation</h2>

<p>Altough is a small city, it has a regional airport (SAF) with nonstop flights from Dallas, Denver, and Phoenix. However, attendees may prefer to fly into the larger Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ). Both airports are connected to the Santa Fe downtown area via car rental or bus shuffle services. More information can be found <a href="https://www.santafe.org/visiting-santa-fe/about-santa-fe/getting-here/">here</a>.</a></p>

<h2 id="alb-airport"><strong>Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ)</strong></h2>

<p>Albuquerque International Airport is the main airport serving the US state of New Mexico, in addition to the Albuquerque metropolitan area and Albuquerque-Santa Fe-Las Vegas area. It offers nonstop flights from Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles and more.</p>

<p>Attendees can then arrive to Santa Fe via Groome Transportation's shuttle bus that connects the Albuquerque airpot to the downtown Santa Fe area where the conference is held. The cost of this service is about 40$ each way.</p>

<p>Car rentals are also available at Albuquerque airport, but note that the Santa Fe downtown area is quite walkable so a car is largely unnecessary.</p>

<p>More Information and booking of Groome Transportation shuttles can be found on their website:</p>

<p><a href="https://groometransportation.com/santa-fe/">https://groometransportation.com/santa-fe/</a></p>

<h2 id="public-transportation"><strong>Public Transportation</strong></h2>

<h2 id="selected-local-attractions">Selected Local Attractions</h2>

<p>Santa Fe has a rich history and is popular for its adobe architecture and surrounding mountains (<a href="https://www.santafe.org/things-to-do/">santafe things to do</a>). The city has won numerous accolades: Travel+Leisure magazine placed Santa Fe at #2 in its 2019 "Best Cities in the United States" list, and it was one of Forbes Magazine's editor's picks in "Where TO Go Next: 14 Best Places To Travel In The US In 2019", among others. CLUSTER attendees can enjoy some of the most popular attractions, such as:</p>


<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Georgia O'Keeffe Museum</strong>: Known for her New Mexico landscapes, New York Skyscrapers and enlarged flowers, Georgia O'Keeffe has been called "The Mother of American Modernism". The musuem is dedicated to O'Keeffe's artistic legacy, her life, American modernism and public engagement. The musuem provides public and private tours led by one of the staff gallery guides. It also provides group admission of nine or more people. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Loretto Chapel</strong>: lies at the center of Santa Fe's historic area, this chapel is a former Roman Catholic church. The chapel was built from locally quarried sandstone and took five years to complete. It is known for its "miraculous" spiral staircase, which rises up at ~6 meters while making two full turns without any support of poles. The staircase is mostly built of wood and is held without any glue or hardware. The staircase was subject to many pop culture adaptations in television and historical fiction novels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The Palace Of The Governors</strong>: A New Mexico History museum. It is an adobe structure built in the Territorial Style of Pueblo architecutre. Dating back to 1610, the Palace is the oldest public building in continuous use constructed by European settlers in the US. The structure of the palace has been modified over the centuries to meet changing needs and stylistic interests. The Palace has many histoic associations such as: the Spanish colonial life, Pueblo Revolt, Mexican Rule, settlement as an American territory, and statehood for New Mexico. In early 20th century, the building was designated as the home for the Museum of New Mexico.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>New Mexico State Capitol Building</strong>: Informally known as "The Roundhouse", the only round state capitol in the United States. It was designed to resemble the Zia Sun Symbol when viewed from above. It has four entrance wings that stick out from the main cylindrical volume. The Capitol is an architectural mix of New Mexico territorial stule and neoclassical influences. Guided and self-guided tours are free to the public.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A bit further afield (a long walk or a short drive or bus trip) is Museum Hill, Museum of International Folk Art, Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, and Santa Fe Botanical Garden. Also, Santa Fe is home of the New Mexico Memorial Military Museum (formally the Bataan Memorial Museum), housed in a building listed in the National Register of Historic Places. CLUSTER attendees with small children might bring them to the adjacent Santa Fe Children's Museum, which presents numerous hands-on science- and art-related activities.</p>
