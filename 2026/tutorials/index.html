                <p>SYCL is an open standard from the Khronos Group and defines a programming model that lets developers
                  support a wide variety of
                  devices (CPUs, GPUs, and more) from a single code base. Given the growing heterogeneity of processor
                  roadmaps in both HPC and AI, moving
                  to an open standard, platform-independent model such as SYCL is essential for modern software
                  developers. SYCL has the further
                  advantage of supporting a single-source style of programming using completely standard C++. In this
                  tutorial, we will introduce SYCL and
                  provide programmers with a solid foundation they can build on to gain mastery of this language. The
                  main benefit of using SYCL over other
                  heterogeneous programming models is the single programming language approach, which enables one to
                  target multiple devices using the same
                  programming model, and therefore to have a cleaner, portable, and more readable code. This is a
                  hands-on tutorial. The real learning will
                  happen as students write code. The format will be short presentations followed by hands-on exercises.
                  Hence, attendees will require their
                  own laptop to perform the hands-on exercises.

                <p>Arm technology has become a compelling choice for HPC due to its promise of efficiency, density,
                  scalability, and broad software
                  ecosystem support. Arm expansion in the datacentre started in 2018 with Arm Neoverse, a set of
                  infrastructure CPU IPs designed for
                  high-end computing. The Arm-based Fugaku supercomputer, first of its kind implementing Arm SVE
                  instruction set, entered the Top 500 in June
                  2020 scoring at the top and retaining a leadership position over the years not only in HPL but also
                  for HPCG (where it is still unbeaten).
                  This event has been a wake-up call for the HPC community. The datacentre and HPC space have long been
                  dominated by x86 CPUs. There
                  is a growing interest in diversifying and exploring new computing architectures to re-create a vibrant
                  and diverse ecosystem as it was
                  more than a decade ago. To further advance datacentre and accelerated computing solutions, NVIDIA has
                  built the Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip
                  which brings together the groundbreaking performance of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU with the versatility of
                  the Neoverse-based NVIDIA Grace
                  CPU, tightly connected with a high bandwidth and memory coherent chip-2-chip (C2C) interconnect. At
                  supercomputing scale, high density
                  clustered solutions such as the HPE Cray EX4000 equipped with 4-way GH200 nodes provide a unique
                  scale-out platform for accelerated
                  supercomputing, AI, and the convergence of the two. In this tutorial, our experts will answer any
                  questions you may have about fully
                  unlocking the scientific computing potential of the Grace CPU, Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip, and HPE
                  EX4000 supercomputing system. Speakers
                  will guide the attendees through compile, execute, profile and optimize HPC and AI workloads to
                  demystify those claims that changing
                  CPU architecture and scaling up is hard. Attendees will learn how to leverage the GH200 unique
                  architecture via live demonstrations and
                  practical hands-on. Remote access to Isambard-AI, the largest AI supercomputer in the UK operated by
                  University of Bristol and funded by UKRI, will be provided.

                <p>High-Performance Networking technologies are generating a lot of excitement towards building next
                  generation High-End Computing (HEC)
                  systems for HPC and AI with GPGPUs, accelerators, and Data Center Processing Units (DPUs), and a
                  variety of application workloads. This
                  tutorial will provide an overview of these emerging technologies, their architectural features,
                  current market standing, and suitability
                  for designing HEC systems. It will start with a brief overview of IB, HSE, RoCE, and Omni-Path
                  interconnect. An in-depth overview of the
                  architectural features of these interconnects will be presented. It will be followed with an overview
                  of the emerging NVLink/NVSwitch,
                  EFA, Slingshot and Tofu-D architectures. We will then present advanced features of commodity
                  high-performance networks that enable
                  performance and scalability. We will then provide an overview of enhanced offload capable network
                  adapters like DPUs/IPUs (Smart NICs),
                  their capabilities and features. After this, we will present an overview of dedicated AI hardware such
                  as the Cerebras family of
                  processors and Intel’s Habana-Gaudi Processors along with their Habana Collective Communication
                  Library (HCCL). Next, we will present an
                  overview of software stacks for high-performance networks like Open Fabrics Verbs, LibFabrics, and UCX
                  comparing the performance of these
                  stacks will be given. Next, challenges in designing MPI library for these interconnects, solutions and
                  sample performance numbers will be
                  presented. We will also provide some hands-on exercises to aid in the understanding of network-level
                  performance and how the network impacts
                  MPI-level performance as well.

              <b>A practical introduction to programming the Tenstorrent Tensix architecture for HPC</b>, Nick Brown
              (EPCC, The University of Edinburgh), Felix Le Clair (Tenstorrent), Jake Davies (EPCC, The University of
              Edinburgh)
              <details>
                <summary style="margin-bottom: 1em;"><u>Tutorial description (click to expand)</u></summary>
                <p>Tenstorrent’s Tensix architecture forms the basis of a new class of accelerator built upon RISC-V
                  that decouples the movement of data from
                  compute. In this technology each accelerator contains many Tensix cores, connected by a
                  high-performance Network on Chip (NoC), with
                  each core containing a dedicated wide matrix and vector unit that is capable of performing 2048
                  multiplications and additions per cycle.
                  Whilst the Tensix was initially developed for machine learning workloads, the entire software stack
                  was made open-source last year
                  and the wider HPC community have started to port codes to the architecture. Indeed, work to date has
                  demonstrated significant energy
                  efficiency benefits for some HPC workloads on the Tensix without sacrificing performance. Moreover,
                  the hardware itself is
                  competitively priced (around $1000), meaning that this is a realistic solution for workstation-class
                  computing, potentially delivering a
                  useful performance boost (and energy saving) for workloads running on machines that range from large
                  scale supercomputers to local “under
                  the desk” resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this practical focussed tutorial you will become familiar with the Tensix architecture by getting
                  hands on with the Wormhole accelerator
                  and learning how to program it using the SDK. Running on real physical hardware throughout, the
                  overall purpose is for attendees to reach a
                  situation where they can start experimenting with the Tensix for their own applications and also gain
                  a wider understanding of how RISC-V
                  enables this flexibility. With experienced Tensix developers as tutors, including a Tenstorrent
                  engineer, attendees will be able to
                  discuss porting of their own codes to the machine as part of this session and ultimately join the
                  rapidly growing global developer
                  community.

                <p>
                  Production HPC software and system is becoming increasingly complex due to its deep software
                  abstractions as well as hardware hierarchies.
                  Such software and system complexity usually leads to unexpected inefficiencies that are hard to detect
                  and locate at large scale
                  through manual inspection. Versatile profilers have revealed a promising way to detect the above
                  inefficiencies with accurate root
                  cause analysis for optimization guidance, which is vital to achieve superior performance for
                  scientific applications running at extremely
                  large scale. In this tutorial, we will present a series of works on various profilers that detect
                  performance inefficiencies due to
                  sub-optimal computation, communication and I/O occurring at large scale. After the presentation of
                  each profiler, we will provide
                  hands-on exercises to acquaint the audience with the usage of each profiler and showcase the
                  effectiveness of each profiler for guiding
                  performance optimization. The profilers demonstrated in this tutorial have already been open-sourced
                  for public access.
